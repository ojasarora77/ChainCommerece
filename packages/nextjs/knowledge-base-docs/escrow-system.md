# Escrow System Documentation

## How Escrow Works
1. **Order Creation**: Buyer places order and funds are locked in smart contract
2. **Seller Notification**: Seller receives notification to ship product
3. **Delivery Confirmation**: Buyer confirms receipt or 7-day auto-release triggers
4. **Fund Release**: Funds released to seller after confirmation
5. **Dispute Handling**: AI-powered resolution if issues arise

## Escrow Timeline
- **Auto-Release**: 7 days after escrow creation
- **Dispute Window**: Available until auto-release
- **Resolution Time**: <2 hours for AI-mediated disputes
- **Appeal Process**: Manual arbitrator review if needed

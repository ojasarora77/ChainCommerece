## 🎯 The Problem

Current e-commerce platforms suffer from three critical issues:
- **Generic AI recommendations** based solely on purchase history, ignoring user values (sustainability, ethics, budget)
- **Trust gaps** with fake reviews, opaque pricing, and centralized dispute resolution
- **Cross-chain fragmentation** limiting liquidity and user choice across different blockchain networks

## 💡 Our Solution

A decentralized marketplace that combines ethical AI-driven recommendations with trustless smart contract escrow, enabling seamless cross-chain commerce.

### Core Features

| Feature | Chainlink Service | Real-World Impact |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Ethical AI Recommendations** | Functions + AWS Bedrock | Personalized matching based on values, not just history |
| **Cross-Chain Product Discovery** | CCIP | Unified liquidity across Avalanche & Ethereum |
| **Trustless Escrow** | VRF + Automation | Eliminates payment fraud and dispute delays |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Data Streams | Real-time price adjustments for crypto volatility |
| **Fraud-Resistant Reviews** | VRF + Proof of Reserve | Cryptographically secure reputation system |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **ProductRegistry.sol** (Avalanche) - Product listings with metadata
- **AIEscrow.sol** (Ethereum) - Stablecoin escrow with automated release
- **CrossChainBridge.sol** - CCIP integration for cross-chain visibility
- **ReputationSystem.sol** - VRF-based review validation

### AI Integration (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

2. **Discovery**: AI recommends products across all chains based on values + real-time data
3. **Purchase**: Cross-chain transaction via CCIP, funds locked in escrow
4. **Delivery**: Chainlink Automation monitors shipping APIs, auto-releases on delivery
5. **Review**: VRF randomly selects verified purchasers for tamper-proof reviews

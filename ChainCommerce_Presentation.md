## Slide 2: The Problem We're Solving
### $6.3 Trillion E-commerce Market Faces Critical Issues

🔴 **Generic AI Recommendations**
- Based solely on purchase history
- Ignores user values (sustainability, ethics, budget)
- 40% of consumers prioritize sustainability but can't find it

🔴 **Trust Gaps**
- Fake reviews plague platforms
- Opaque pricing mechanisms
- Centralized dispute resolution takes 14+ days

🔴 **Cross-Chain Fragmentation**
- Limited liquidity across blockchain networks
- Users locked into single ecosystems
- Missed opportunities for optimal pricing

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution
### Decentralized Marketplace with Ethical AI

**Core Innovation:**
Combining ethical AI-driven recommendations with trustless smart contract escrow, enabling seamless cross-chain commerce.

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Values-based AI matching instead of generic recommendations
- ✅ Cryptographic arbitration replacing centralized disputes
- ✅ Cross-chain freedom eliminating platform lock-in
- ✅ VRF-verified authenticity solving fake review problem
- ✅ Dynamic market pricing vs static traditional pricing
